The client is me! Slowly building my personal website. Was going to do my dog, but this seemed more practical in the long run and to keep me focused. 


TODO 
Media Queries what and why 



January 28th: Button Day 
  trying to get it in my media q to hide 
  reverse engineer time 
  

January 29th: 
Background Image day. Sheesh. 
Trying to get my displays on mobile to translate but likely need some flexbox columns. Gonna give it a shot. 
Also realized I was in the wrong repo. Going to move these over now and commit then continue to make changes.
